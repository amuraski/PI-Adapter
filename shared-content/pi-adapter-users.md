# PI Adapter users

PI Adapters are typically used by users who:

- Operate in an edge environment
- Operate on-premises but are interested in interpreting data from an edge environment

The following are frequent PI Adapter users.

## Information Systems Developer

Information Systems Developers use PI Adapters as part of the systems and apps that they are maintaining. The goal is to have PI Adapters run without any interruptions to guarantee that the operators and information management directors are satisfied and able to do their work.

PI Adapters' installation functions, such as containerizing using Docker and troubleshooting options, are essential for the Information Systems Developer's work.

## Operator

Operators assist Information Management Directors by using PI Adapters to monitor that time-series data from day-to-day remote assets or networks that are routed to EDS, PI Server, or OCS for storage or data management. The operator makes sure that the PI Adapter process runs per specification, which means that no interruption or data loss occurs.

PI Adapters' administrative functions, such as starting and stopping the adapter or a component, proper buffering configuration, and monitoring health and diagnostic functions, are crucial for the operator's work.

## Director Information Management

Information Management Directors use PI Adapters to manage time-series data from remote assets or networks and turn them into information tailored for their customers and partners' needs.

PI Adapters' configuration functions, such as data selection, data filtering, or egress endpoint configuration, help Information Management Directors to manage and process data according to their needs.
