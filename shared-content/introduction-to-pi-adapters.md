# Introduction to PI Adapters

PI Adapters are data collection components that provide access to time-series data previously isolated on remote assets or in secondary networks. Available for Windows and Linux devices, PI Adapters pull real-time data from IIoT gateways and sensor-enabled equipment and securely route the data to:

- Edge Data Store (EDS) for additional edge applications 
- PI Server for on-premises storage 
- OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS) for cloud-hosted data management service

PI Adapters offer the following generic capabilities:

- Connection to [inbound data](#inbound-data) sources from common industrial protocols
- Real-time [data transfer](#data-transfer) to PI Server, OCS, and EDS with optional data filtering to manipulate data on the outbound side
- [Buffering](#buffering) to overcome network and system disruptions
- [Administration](#administration) functions for simplified management, scalable installation, and configuration

## Capabilities in detail

The following capabilities are available for every PI Adapter. A specific PI Adapter may or may not include additional capabilities, such as network proxy support or data source auto discovery.

### Inbound data

PI Adapters provide connections to a variety of inbound data sources from common industrial protocols.

The optional stream metadata capability allows you to set the amount of metadata sent with each stream. Metadata are different for every adapter type and you can configure the number of metadata to be displayed.

For more information, see the Data source configuration and Data selection configuration topics.

### Data transfer

PI Adapters allow you to transfer real-time data to one or more egress endpoint: PI Server, OSIsoft Cloud Services (OCS), or Edge Data Store (EDS). The data filtering capability improves the configuration flexibility by manipulating data on the outbound side and minimizes network bandwidth consumption through exception reporting capabilities.

For more information, see [Egress endpoints configuration](xref:EgressEndpointsConfiguration).

### Buffering

The PI Adapters' buffering capability creates a robust data collection for data egressed from the adapter to egress endpoints or health endpoints. Buffering helps to overcome network and system disruptions that often result in data loss.

For more information, see [Buffering configuration](xref:BufferingConfiguration).

### Administration

PI Adapters provide administrative functions such as starting and stopping of an adapter or ingress component, or deleting an adapter component. Administrative functions simplify management and make installation and configuration scalable.

For more information, see [Administration](xref:Administration).
